This repository contains my solutions for the assignments for this MOOC. I am currently working on this course; hence, some of the solutions are incomplete. I will try to comment the code as much as I can to make my solutions clear.

It goes without saying that the solutions are my own and they might contain
mistakes. If you find any, please let me know. I am happy to hear as many
feedback as possible.
